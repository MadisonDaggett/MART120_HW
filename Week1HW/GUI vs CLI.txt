GUI stands for graphical user interface and CLI stands for command line interface. Both CLI and GUI are tools that allow the user to give commands to the computer. The GUI consists of buttons, icons, and windows on a computer, where the CLI allows the user to enter lines of code to give commands to the computer. The GUI functions as a user friendly way to give computer commands. Using GUI might include changing settings, creating new files, and opening or downloading applications, among others. Overall, GUI is used more commonly in day to day computer usage. CLI relies on the user to write code in order to give the computer commands. Because CLI is less accessible to the average computer user, CLI is used less often to give computer commands. CLI may be used for troubleshooting or by IT professionals to issue commands to the computer. Any command that can be given to a computer with GUI could also be done with CLI, but CLI requires more knowledge of code and computer commands. CLI is a more technical way of giving the computer commands, therefore CLI is more often used to solve complex issues or give complex commands that the GUI may not be capable of doing.
